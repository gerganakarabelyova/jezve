This arcade game is a prototype I built for a subject at the university in 2015. The subject was called "Project management" and it was mostly learning about different project management methodologies, like Scrum and Kanban. I was required to build the foundation of an imaginary app or game, as an end course project, and then write the documentation for it. This documentation included project budget, methodology that I think will be best, milestones, risk management, a list of possible problems and complications, required skills and programmers and so on. The project got an Excellent score and the highest mark in the course. The concept is simillar to the game "SpongeBob SquarePants Dinner Dash" and the graphics I made with Adobe Photoshop and some Google images.
